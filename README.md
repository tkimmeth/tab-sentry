# tab-sentry
A browser extension that tackles the everyday struggle of tab overload. It automatically identifies inactive tabs, groups them for review, and gently closes them after a countdown. This saves memory and reduces clutter efficiently, while keeping your important work safe.




## Known Limitations / Future Improvements

- Whitelisting exists, but currently requires a few manual steps. **Planned improvement: one-click "whitelist this domain" from the menu**.  
- Queue behavior after refresh can be unclear — we plan to make the order more transparent in the UI.  
- Currently only tested on Chrome; Firefox/Edge compatibility is a future goal.  
~ - Active audio/video tabs may still be closed — we’d like to add detection so these are preserved automatically.  ~
